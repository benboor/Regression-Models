#Executive summary on Motor Trend Data from 1974 

-Is Automatic or manual tramission better for MPG?

-Quantification of the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

This project is designed to answer the above questions. The data used in this project comes from the 1974  Motor Trend Magazine. This edition of the publication contained a dataset with information about fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design for 32 different 1973-74 vehicles.
The dataset is reffered to as mtcars can be found at http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html

The analysis led to the following conclusions and questions.

- Manual transmissions have better MPG than Automatic transmission. However, the ability to predict the MPG of a vehicle based on its transmission type is severly limited and not the most accurate predictive variable.

- Manual transmissions have an approximately 4-7 MPG advantage over automatic transmissions. Again however, the ability to predict a vehicles MPG based on trasmission type is severly limited. More useful predictive variables are weight, quarter mile time and number of carborators.


##Data preprocessing

The first step in the analysis of the data is loading it into R from its built in library.
```r
data(mtcars)
```
And processing the data so as to allow it to be used by relevant functions found later within the analysis.
```r
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
levels(mtcars$am) <- c("Automatic", "Manual")
```

##Exploratory data analysis

An exploratory data analysis of categorical data with real numbered values is best completed using a box plot. As such, one was produced.

```r
boxplot(mpg~am, data = mtcars, col = c(" light blue", "light blue"), xlab = "Transmission type", ylab = "Miles per Gallon", main = "Miles per gallon for automatic and manual transmissions")
		
		
```

The exploratory data analysis using the boxplot shows that the mean value for manual transmissions is higher than the mean value for automatic transmissions.
The boxplot also shows that the range of values for automatic and manual transmissions overlaps.


##Selecting a regression model

An initial model of mpg against each of the 11 available variables provided can be produced using the following code.

```r
lm(mpg ~ factor(am)*.,data=mtcars)
```

The summary statistics of this model are available in the appendix under the section 'Model 1 summary statistics'. 
This model produces a model with an R-squared error of .9625 and as such explains 96% of variance between the vehicles.
Additional models can and should be produced however, in order to investigate which variables are most signficant.

```r
lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + carb, data=mtcars)
```
The summary statistics of this model are available in the appendix under the section 'Model 2 summary statistics'. 
As seen in this model by selecting only the distinction between automatic and manual,  the weight of the vehicle, 1/4th mile time and the number of carburetors the r-squared error is reduced to .8568, however the number of variables used is significantly reduced.


A model only using the distinction between automatic and manual transmissions can also be produced.
```r
lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)
```

However as the summary in  the appendix entiteld 'Model 3 summary statistics' bellow shows, this model has a signficantly lower r-squared error of .3598, and as such does not have as much predictive power as do the two other models considered.

Therefore it is fairly evident that the second model produced is the most useful one.

##Residual plotting and diagnostic

![scaleLocation](scaleLocation.jpeg)

As seen in the residual plots above, the lines of best fit are sufficiently well fitted upon visual inspection when using a model which includes MPG relative to weight, quarter mile time and number of carborators.

##Conclusion

It is evident that in addition to distinction between automatic and manual transmission, the number of cylinders in the vehicle, the quarter mile time and the weight fo the car are all significant in defining the MPG of the vehicle being investigated. Transmission is useful in defining MPG, however, the aformentioned variables have more predictive power in relation to the overall MPG than transmission does.
